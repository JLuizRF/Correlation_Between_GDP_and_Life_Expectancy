# Is a high GDP a good thing for a country? Can Life Expectancy tell us something about it? 

Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. As such, it also measures the income earned from that production, or the total amount spent on final goods and services (less imports).

GDP is a famous and common measure method, but does it has a real positive impact as it goes up. Determining cause and effect is not a simple thing to do, but we can get a closer look at other important variables and comparate their correlation with GDP, to get a better understanding of this matter.   

One of the interesting variables to look at is Life Expectancy, as it is the key metric for assessing population health. Broader than the narrow metric of the infant and child mortality, which focus solely at mortality at a young age, life expectancy captures the mortality along the entire life course. It tells us the average age of death in a population.

So, with this in mind, this project aims to analyze the correlation between Life Expectancy and GDP to get a better understanding of the relationship between these two variables. 

# Correlation_Between_GDP_and_Life_Expectancy
This project aims to analyze the correlation between GDP and Life Expectancy in six countries with different social, economic, and geographic realities. 

### But what is correlation? 
Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related (meaning they change together at a constant rate). It’s a common tool for describing simple relationships without making a statement about cause and effect.

### How is correlation measured?
The sample correlation coefficient, r, quantifies the strength of the relationship. Correlations are also tested for statistical significance.

### What are some limitations of correlation analysis?
Correlation can’t look at the presence or effect of other variables outside of the two being explored. Importantly, correlation doesn’t tell us about cause and effect. Correlation also cannot accurately describe curvilinear relationships.
